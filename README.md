# logsShortener
A script that takes in a series of logs and groups them by similarity using the Levenshtein distance formula.

## Notes
1. `index.py` contains the logic of how the logs are being grouped and parsed through.
2. To use `index.py` you will need a JSON file structured similar to the one in `logs.json`
3. The output of the script is recorded in `output.json`
